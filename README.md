## BetterContact Introduction

BetterContact is the first and only AI-powered waterfall enrichment platform that combines 20+ premium data sources into one unified tool. Instead of paying for multiple subscriptions to services like Apollo, Hunter, RocketReach, ContactOut, and Datagma separately, BetterContact gives you access to all of them through a single platform.

Here's what makes BetterContact stand out from traditional contact enrichment tools:

**Waterfall Enrichment Technology:** BetterContact uses a smart sequential approach. When you search for a contact, it automatically queries multiple data providers one after another until it finds verified information. If Provider A doesn't have the data, it moves to Provider B, then C, and so on. This dramatically increases your success rate compared to using a single provider.

**Pay Only for Valid Data:** Unlike most competitors, BetterContact only charges credits when it successfully finds AND verifies contact information. No data found? No charge. This means you're never wasting money on dead ends or unverified information.

**Advanced Verification:** Every email address is verified through multiple layers including SMTP validation and real-time catch-all verification powered by Bouncer. This protects your sender reputation and ensures you're reaching real inboxes. Phone numbers undergo verification including format validation, geo-matching, and activity scoring.

**Access to 3 Billion+ Contacts:** Through its 20+ integrated data sources, BetterContact taps into over 3 billion contact records, providing some of the highest find rates in the industry. Users report enrichment rates of 60-80% or higher, significantly better than single-provider solutions.

**Seamless Integrations:** BetterContact works where you work. It integrates directly with HubSpot, Google Sheets, Clay, Make.com, Zapier, and offers a robust API for custom workflows. You can enrich contacts without leaving your CRM or spreadsheet.

The platform is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and EU-DSGVO regulations, processing over 150,000 secure data enrichments daily for 1,000+ companies worldwide.
